    <p>I love the sound of birds
so early in the morn,
I like the sound of puppies soon after they are born.
I love the smell of flowers
and the taste of honey from bees.
I love the sound the wind makes when it?s blowing through the trees.
I love the way the sky looks on a bright and sunny day,
and even when it?s rainy, I love the shades of gray.
I love the smell of the ocean, the sound of waves upon the sand,
I love the feel of seashells and how they look in my hand.
And when the sun is gone, I love the moon that shines so bright,
I love the sounds of crickets and other creatures of the night.
So when I lay me down to sleep, I thank the Lord above,
For all the things of nature and more, all the things I love.</p>

      <h4>A POEM FOR KIDS.</h4>
      <br />
      
      <p>The dawn is gleeful
With the shadow of my beloved.
It cheers
With the tone of her voice.
The sun welcomes the morn,
With the painting of my beloved.
She flashes the light
To show her eternal beauty.
The sky is proud
With her reddish color.
I?m so costly
Because of my divine sweetheart.
I?ve forgotten all the spheres of life
Except for the morn.
I?ve forgotten all
Except for my divine sweetheart.</p>

      <h4> ANOTHER KIDS POEM.</h4>
      <br />
      
      <p>A cuckoo bird breaks the silence
Of the wintry morning.
Although all the people are sleeping,
She appeals us,
With her happy note,
To awaken from the wintry bed.
And how to begin a day?s work.
She hides her face
With a veil of darkness.
But she unveils her face
In the wintry night.
She sings
To give the odor
And the perfection of the wintry dawn.
Let?s praise
For the eternal bird.
Let?s sing
For her divine voice,
Who breaks the silence
Of the wintry morning.
And welcomes the day with her divine singing.</p>
